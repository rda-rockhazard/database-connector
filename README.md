# database-connector
A database connector program to use as a JAR for connection of MySQL database.

> I have created this program to connect with MySQL database only. I will modify this in future. This might not be helpful in the enterprise world but is meant for the users who are using JDBC-ODBC connectivity to connect with database and are tired of wiriting the same old code for connectivity.

- A Java based program meant to simplyfy JDBC connections.
- Have methods to create a DB connection on a simple instance creation.
- Specifically made to import as a jar (Compile. Create JAR. Ready to use.).
- Ready to use JAR is available in this repo.


**NOTE: This program was implemented a few years ago from the date of its release here. Might need changes. Open to suggesstions. If you want to contribute, I am open to that too.**
