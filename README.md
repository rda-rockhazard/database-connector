# database-connector
A database connector program to use as a JAR for connection of MySQL database.

> I have created this program to connect with MySQL database only. I will modify this in the near future. This might not be helpful in the enterprise world but is meant for the users who are using JDBC-ODBC connectivity to connect with database and are tired of writing the same old code for connectivity.

- A Java based program meant to simplify JDBC connections and simple database operations.
- Have methods to create a DB connection on a simple instance creation.
- Specifically made to import as a jar (Compile. Create JAR. Ready to use.).
- Ready to use JAR is available in this repo.


**NOTE: I implemented this program in the initial days of my career when I was still learning to code and was tired of writing the same code in every project for database connectivity. Definitely needs an upgrade. Open to suggestions and contributions.**
